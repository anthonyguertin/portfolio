I am an avid programmer and I enjoy to learn as much as humanly <br />possible about different technologies for the betterment of society.<br />
I spend both my professional and my free time programming. I cannot<br /> function properly without my daily dose of programming. Between 
that <br />and exercise, my beautiful wife Jourdan trumps them all. My dog Rocco<br /> keeps me busy too :)

This website will help you get an idea of who I am and what I am all about.<br /> Through the navigation bar at the top of this site 
you can look at some of<br /> my past work that I have done. If you click the "Contact Me" link, there is <br /> a form for filling out information 
and I will get back to you asap.
